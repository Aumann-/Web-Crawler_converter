C++ converter/cleaner program for files generated by the web crawler.

This program will take in files generated by the web crawler to perform cleaning/converting functions on the data.

The program will follow basic steps, each asking for confirmation, to remove blank spaces, count data lines, convert to .txt, .csv, .html, and other such functions.

Currently pending is a cleaning algorithm to change the URL to domain only (www.?.com/login > www.?.com)
