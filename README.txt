C++ converter/cleaner program for files generated by the web crawler.

This program will take in files generated by the web crawler to perform cleaning/converting functions on the data.

The program will follow basic steps, each asking for confirmation, to remove blank spaces, count data lines, convert to .txt, .csv, .html, and other such functions.

Currently pending is a cleaning algorithm to change the URL to domain only (www.?.com/login > www.?.com)



Updated 2/16: When working with duplicates or tocrawl files from the web crawler, the program will count the occurrence of each link in the file and will write the link and its count to a csv file for use by the analyzer.

Removed features: 	Program will not count data lines anymore.
			Program will not confirm exiting of menu anymore.

Update 2/21: 	Removed cleaning menu for crawled file.
		UNcommented get_occur() call for tocrawl files
