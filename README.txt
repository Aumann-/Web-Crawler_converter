C++ converter program for files generated by the web crawler.

This program will take in files generated by the web crawler to perform converting functions on the data.

The program will ask what file is being converted (crawled links, duplicates, tocrawl).
If crawled, blank lines are removed before conversion.
If duplicates/tocrawl, each unique links if written with a count of its occurrences.

If using a crawled file, program will convert file using a 2D vector of strings, one vector per line. The data will convert from the base txt file into the following format:

a,NA,NA
NA,b,NA
NA,NA,b.a
NA,NA,b.b
NA,c,NA
NA,NA,c.a

Shown in proper.csv.

The extra NA values ar eneeded in the current version of the analyzer.

Current bugs:

Due to the way in which the data is inserted into each vector, data is inserted in reverse order.

a,NA,NA
NA,c,NA
NA,NA,c.a
NA,b,NA
NA,NA,b.b
NA,NA,b.a
