C++ converter program for files generated by the web crawler.

This program will take in files generated by the web crawler to perform converting functions on the data.

The program will ask what file is being converted (crawled links, duplicates, tocrawl).
If crawled, blank lines are removed before conversion.
If duplicates/tocrawl, each unique links if written with a count of its occurrences.

Pending:
COnversion algorithm for crawled files.
